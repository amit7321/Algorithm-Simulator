# Algorithm-Simulator
### Description
Algorthim is one of the most important and core topic of computer science.Among them sorting algorthims are the most common algrithms.It will be easy for the students to understand if they can visualize the consecutive passess of the sorting algorithms.In this project we want to develop a software will help the students to learn some of the sorting algorithm easily and show them the consecutive passes of those sorting algorithms.Besides the students can also learn the algorithms pseudocode and their implementation in some popular programming languages.The passes can be shown in ascending and descending order. 
### Framework
